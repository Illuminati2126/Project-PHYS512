Final project for PHYS512
Molecular dynamic of electron inside of a two-dimensional electron gas
This will be achieved by using a molecular dynamic method to simulate the movement of electron and the potential with modeled with the classic two-body Coulomb potential. The external electrical field will simply be a input function in the simulation. We also implement a damping term associated to indirectly simulate impurity/defects/phonon scattering. The boundary condition would be reflective boundary with momentum relaxing collision
