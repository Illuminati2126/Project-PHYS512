# Final project for PHYS512
# Classical molecular dynamic of electron inside of a two-dimensional electron gas.

The final report is on the main branch with two main files, results and project_VF.

The Phase Lag Animations folder is where all the gif done for the phase lag are. 

Results.py is the frontend file, it is the file that you should run, if you want to reproduce our results. Just take a case and run it. Only phase lag will have to manully modify the value by hand to reproduce the differents case. Also, for the sweep of the z direction, you will need to use two functions. The rest just call the function named after the case and you will see the results that you want. 

The Project_VF.py is general file with all the code, numerical schemes and everything backend. In theory, you should only open this file to have a look at the inner working of the code. All the code has comment and should be easy to understand and to use, if someone want to do special change.

Animation.py is the code used to create the animation. 

The "Old" folder is just old version of the code
