1. dt=5e-6, tau=1e-4, omega=1e3 (Figure 4 in report)

2. dt=5e-6, tau=1e-3, omega=3e4 (Figure 5 in report)

3. dt=5e-6, tau=2e-3, omega=1.5e4 (changing omega, tau such that omega*tau is unchanged)

4. dt=5e-6, tau=1e-4, omega=1e3 (Same as 1., but with 5x density)

5. dt=5e-6, tau=1e-3, omega=3e4 (Same as 2, but with 5x density)

Note that the amplitude of the external driving field is tuned in each case for illustrative convenience.
